# odin-recipes

This project will allow me to create a website with 3 different recipes.
The recipes will be lasagna, a hamburger, and a cheesecake.
The index will contain the links to each of the 3 webpages
Each webpage will have a picture, description of the food, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps to make the food.
