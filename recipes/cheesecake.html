    <h3> New York Cheesecake</h3>
    <p> This popular dessert is larger and richer than the traditional cheesecake, with strawberry sauce added for extra flavor. </p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 18 crushed graham crackers</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li> 1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li> ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 8 ounces of cream cheese</li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li> ⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li> 4 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li> Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
        <li> Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li> Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li> When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
    </ol>
